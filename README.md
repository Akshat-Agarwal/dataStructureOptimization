# DataStructure Optimization
Be it string manipulation or optimizing and conserving memory. I like to do things the perfect way (The question would be. Is there a perfect way?). I have a set of my optimizations and solutions to common (and not-so-common) programming problems such as checking for anagram strings or printing duplicate characters from a string.
This are all the algorithms you will be learning when you will start to learn the data structures.
